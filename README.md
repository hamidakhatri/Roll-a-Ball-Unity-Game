# Roll-a-Ball-Unity-Game
This repository contains a Unity-based game project titled "Roll-a-Ball", designed to demonstrate basic game development concepts. The game features a simple yet engaging gameplay where a player controls a rolling ball in a square stage, with the primary objective of collecting items and exploring the area.

Key Features:
- Stage Design: A minimalist square stage that serves as the playground for the rolling ball.
- Player Control: Utilizes W, A, S, and D keys for movement, allowing the ball to roll forward, left, backward, and right at a constant speed.
- Collectibles: Strategically placed items that the player can collect as the ball rolls around the stage.
- Camera Mechanics: A camera that consistently follows the ball at a set distance and elevation, providing a clear view of the action.
- Advanced Challenge: An added feature where players can use the right mouse button to rotate the camera around the ball, offering a complete 360-degree field of view.

Technologies Used:
- Unity Engine for game development and scene setup.
- C# for scripting player movement, camera control, and game logic.
- Concepts of linear algebra for smooth and responsive control mechanics.
